I'm a 21 y/o Swede with a penchant for getting into wild and wacky situations.
I've wanted to make a blog for several years, and now when I'm going to Japan
over Christmas and New Year 2024/25 seems like the perfect opportunity to
finally make one!

I can't really speak on how well updated this will be in the future, but I'll
try my best. If I'm giving up on the site I'll try to remember to write so
here.
