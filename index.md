## Hello!

**Welcome to my blog :D**

I've been wanting to write one for ages, and so here we finally are.
I'm going to Japan over Christmas and New Year 2024/25,
and so instead of updating all my friends and relatives one by one
I have this site instead (knowing me, probably in addition to sending messages xD).

Please write to me if You wanna comment on anything!!
I love telling all my friends and family about whatever is going on in my life,
but what I like more are all of your witty remarks and funny comments!
if You liked something, thought something was funny, think I'm writing too much,
anything! then please send me a message wherever, be it discord or whatsapp or snapchat.

## The future

once the trip is over I'm hoping to continue updating this place
(and putting it on my own website sooner rather than later),
but I'm not actually sure what will happen yet.
I guess we will find out together. until then I hope you enjoy what's here.

happy reading, <br>
