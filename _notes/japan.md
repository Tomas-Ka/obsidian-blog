title: My trip to Japan
---
Over Christmas and New Years 2024/25 my whole family went to Japan together.
This is where I've documented that trip.
We were in there in total of 17, from the 21st of December 2024 to the 6th of January 2025.

I have very quickly realised that it isn't feasible to update this site properly every evening, but I will try my best.
