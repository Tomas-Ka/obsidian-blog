## On our way to the airport
We got up nice and early at 8am, none of us with any sleep. My brother was up chatting with his friends, I was helping him download some anime, Mum was repairing her fleece jacket, and Dad was doing god knows what.

For the first time in my life I had actually packed all my bags beforehand, so I got to just sit around whilst my brother and mum were running around finding the last few things to pack, trying to figure out what those last few missing items were. Honestly it was a very refreshing experience to have packed everything the day before, I can highly recommend it. Knowing myself this might be the one and only time it happens though...

Packing done, we were just on our way out the door when we found out that there **might** have been an accident on the train tracks, causing delayed trains and potentially cancelling some. Not great news for us, but we never did find out if there had actually been a crash or not, as the warning just sort of disappeared, and our train thankfully ended up just being a bit late. In the end we made it to the airport with more time to spare than we had planned for initially even!

Once we arrived at the airport we went to check in our bags, and immediately ran into more problems. We were all checking in luggage (much to dad's dismay), but as we filled in our information at the self service station and waited for it to start printing our luggage tags, it just... didn't. Instead we got met with this lovely error:

Thus we ended up having to find a non self service station, queue for what felt like half an hour, and then finally get our luggage sent on it's merry way.

Thankfully the rest of our experience at Kastrup was quite par for the course. Our plane was 20 minutes late (of course) and I spent the time trying to download even more anime my brother had requested, failing miserably (why can't Ipads install torrent software, like come on apple; let me download my Linux ISOs in peace). Then before we knew it we were about to board towards Helsinki (unfortunately without additional anime however).

As soon as we got on we were welcomed by Father Christmas himself, welcoming us to his airline and wishing us merry holidays (it was really sweet actually, the announcement was both in Finnish and in English). We then had a nice and uneventful flight which pretty much everyone in the family just slept through.

## Helsinki


* which cut into our time at the lounge in Helsinki, but that was manageable, 
* Moomin coffée
* Lounge food
* Bidets already in Finland
* scanned the wrong boardingpass
* some of the stewardesses have red santa hats
* Sat in the airplane a full hour before liftoff
* airplane getting a wash

* My brother gets screwed over by the person in front leaning back and causing his monitor to be impossible to view (seriously, why don't these pivot. I get that it's like a cost saving effort, but can it really be that expensive / brittle?)
* food on the plane
