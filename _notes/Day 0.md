title: "Day 0: The trip to Tokyo"
---
We got up nice and early at 8am, none of us with any sleep. My brother was up chatting with his friends, I was helping him download some anime, Mum was repairing her fleece jacket, and dad was doing god knows what.

For the first time in my life I had actually packed all my bags beforehand, so I got to just sit around whilst my brother and mum were running around finding the last few things to pack, trying to figure out what those last few missing items were. Honestly it was a very refreshing experience to have packed everything the day before, I can highly recommend it.

Packing done we were just on our way out the door when we found out that there **might** have been an accident on the train tracks, causing trains were delayed and potentially cancelled. Not great news for us, and we never did find out if there had actually been one or not, as our train thankfully ended up just being a bit late.

* problems with checking in the bag because of baggage tags not printing

* Note that having packed the day before is really nice and Henry and mum hadn't so I got to see them scramble about for things they'd missed
* Plane late & official Santa airline message 
* Rant about torrenting on iPads
* Bidets already in Finland

* My brother gets screwed over by the person in front leaning back and causing his monitor to be impossible to view (seriously, why don't these pivot. I get that it's like a cost saving effort, but can it really be that expensive / brittle?)
