title: My second trip to Japan
---
Well, last time I tried documenting stuff it ended up taking too much time, and
I never quite finished it (I still really want to though, so I'll probably keep
editing away on that article as I go), so now that I'm going back to Japan for
three weeks now in the summer of 2025 with a group of friends, I'm gonna try to
keep my articles a bit shorter and hopefully that'll make me actually manage to
write something every day.

(I also coded some stuff to make images easier to add in, so everything should
just be a lot easier to finish)

Anyhow, here's to Japan 2; electric boogaloo!
