Today it was time for the Monster Hunter Bar!
There are several videogame themed cafes and bars in Japan, and since one of my friends is a massive Monster Hunter fan we had to go to the one of course (I was quite looking forwards to it, and he promised he'd go to the FFXIV one if I joined him here).

Ordering at the bar was just like any other restaurant, but there was one meal, the enormous "Hunter King Plate" that was only available for pre-order. Since the game is well known for it's massive and delicious looking meals we of course had to get one each!

The restaurant is themed to be rustic and nod to the games as much as it could. There were replicas of weapons, and memorabilia everywhere! One of the servers was even wearing an outfit that could've come straight from the game!

*Making these must've taken a good while...*

We got drinks as well, and to really drive home the point of massive food I of course had to order the massive beer as well (it was a double pint, so a litre of beer).

As we continued eating we learnt that you could play through an in game hunt on one of the consoles nearby, and if you managed to complete it you'd get a voucher for Â¥300 off the next time you came by! My friend spent a little while getting his gear together whilst I walked around taking photos, and then proceeded to whoop monster butt, clearing the hunt in a fifth of the time required!

*"Ez" - friend*
</span>

Just before we left he also left a notice on the quest board at the bar, leaving a little calling card for other hunters coming on by. We also took a minute to trade some of the trading cards you got with the meals!

*This is such a sweet idea for getting to know other MH fans.*

To finish off the evening we went around some close by stores, and I finally found some FFXIV merch I've been looking for since last time I was here, as well as Guilty Gear stuff, which I haven't really seen anywhere else (not that I've been looking though).
