Today was another chill day for me. Two of my friends went into town to see the Imperial palace gardens and check out Tokyo tower, but I stayed home to finally catch up on some well needed rest (and to catch up on writing this blog a bit).

I did find some FFXIV stuff I had forgotten to open, so I did some magnet gacha, and got these cuties!

*Look at them, they're adorable!*

We went to get Chinese food, but ordered too little, and since we got takeout we ended up having to order extra Dominos. The guy we ordered from was incredibly sweet though, and he helped us with both images from the restaurant Instagram, and by asking lots of questions about what we would want. Was incredibly nice of him, and greatly appreciated although it did make us rush just a tiny little bit xD

> Slowly catching up to my backlog of days xD most of them are done except for day 8... We went to the aquarium and I took way too many pictures.
> The hardest part of this is still definitely putting in the images. I'll have to try and improve that workflow even more at some point
