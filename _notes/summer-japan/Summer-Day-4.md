So, today was kind of hectic and so I didn't quite have time to write anything until quite a few days after. Hope it's still enjoyable though! 

The morning started early, way earlier than planned actually. After a late last night (around 2-3am) spent cursing the horrible login system for our new hotel, which first crashed with a unreadable error page (both because it was configured to, but also because my laptop doesn't have Japanese characters installed and thus it was just a bunch of boxes), and then crashed because the images I uploaded were too big. Eventually I filled everything in for a 3rd time on my phone instead, and that got me to a confirmation screen! Unfortunately I didn't get any confirmation email or anything about it, and when I went back to the page it still said I had to send them info, so I did it again and just decided that it went fine that time (even without a confirmation email).

# Leaving the apartment
The plan was to sleep for 6 hours or so and then just wake up and just walk out of the door. Of course that didn't happen. When the others got home from their night out partying **at 6 am** it turns out that the friend who was staying in the apartment with me had accidentally locked both the locks of the apartment; Including the one that wasn't openable from the outside, which naturally meant they had to call and wake me up in order to get in (which fortunately for them worked really well). To compound this bad luck we checked out just barely on time, and didn't make it down to the automated checkout desk until a few minutes after our timeslot, which of course meant that we couldn't check out at all.

I tried to contact the people we were renting from, but since we didn't have any available phone numbers we couldn't call and the Booking.com chat wasn't working we had to give up and just continue on...

We took the tram to Tokyo station and after a **lot** of searching around for somewhere to put our bags we finally managed to find a free locker and put some bags in there. When I say a lot of searching, I do really mean a lot. There were lockers absolutely everywhere, but they were all full, and as we were looking around we saw plenty of other people who were also on the prowl for someone to put their bags somewhere. We probably spent upwards of 20-30 minutes just walking around rows upon rows of lockers before finally finding a single one we could use.

Since we couldn't enter our new apartment until quite a few hours later we now had some time to kill, and we decided to handle it in very different ways. Me and the guy who stayed home the day previous decided to go out on a trip to Nakano Broadway, in a search for some specific Gacha machines (and just to check out the area in general). 
Meanwhile the sleep deprived drunkardsâ„¢, found a nice area to sit down in, and we left them there whilst leaving on our little expedition.

# Gacha time at Nakano Broadway

</span>
</span>
Nakano Broadway was really cool! As I wrote I went there for Gachapon, but we found so much other cool stuff. First of course was the actual Broadway itself, but then we ended up inside some sort of shopping mall with four interlocking floors! We saw probably upwards of 8-900 gacha machines over 13-15 locations, and I did finally found what  was looking for, or well partially. One of my friends who were here (and also my brother) were looking for figurines from Apothecary Diaries, and I did manage to find some. Not the ones I originally was looking for (we'll have to find them some other time) but still! I unfortunately didn't remember my brother wanted some until after I left, so I'll have to come back some other time.

*Now **THAT'S** an Ice-cream!*
</span>
</span>

As a treat to my friend for suffering through the "Liminal Hell", we got some ice-cream, and he proceeded to absolutely demolish this giant thing. Unfortunately eating that much ice-cream comes with downsides, such as horrible brain-freeze. After taking a while to sort that we felt finished with the Broadway for now and returned back to the others.

# New apartment
We picked up the others and then we were finally on our way to the new apartment!

Unfortunately it was quite warm today as well, and since we were carrying all our bags and stuff it felt like it took ages to travel to our place, but we persevered and after what felt like half an hour (it was 10 minutes). Once we arrived and typed in the **fourteen character pin for the door**

We immediately spread out all over and scattered all our belongings to the four winds. It looks like we've been here for a week already xD

# Dinner!
For dinner we went to this local curry place. Took quite a while to get food, and their menu was surprisingly small for an indian place, but it tasted really good!

> So, uh it's happening again. I'm quite a few days behind on this again from being busy vacationing. It *should* be fine and I should catch up in the next little while, but I am a little bummed about it xD
