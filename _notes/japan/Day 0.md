## On our way to the airport
We got up nice and early at 8am, none of us with any sleep. My brother was up chatting with his friends, I was helping him download some anime, Mum was repairing her fleece jacket, and Dad was doing god knows what. A pretty standard evening all things considered.

For the first time in my life I had actually packed all my bags beforehand, so I got to just sit around whilst my brother and mum were running around finding things they had forgotten to pack, trying to figure out what those last few missing items were. Honestly it was a very refreshing experience to have packed everything the day before, I can highly recommend it. Knowing myself this might be the one and only time it happens though...

Packing done, we were just on our way out the door when we found out that there **might** have been an accident on the train tracks, causing delayed trains and potentially cancelling some. Not great news for us, but we never did find out if there had actually been a crash or not, as the warning just sort of disappeared, and our train thankfully ended up just being a bit late. In the end we made it to the airport with more time to spare than we had planned for initially even!

Once we arrived at the airport we went to check in our bags, and immediately ran into more problems. We were all checking in luggage (much to dad's dismay), but as we filled in our information at the self service station and waited for it to start printing our luggage tags, it just... didn't. Instead we got met with this lovely error:

*technology doing what technology is wont to do*

Thus we ended up having to find a non self service station, queue for what felt like half an hour, and then finally get our luggage sent on it's merry way (the service personal was very nice).

Thankfully the rest of our experience at Kastrup was more par for the course. Our plane was 20 minutes late (of course) and I spent the time trying to download even more anime my brother had requested, failing miserably (why can't Ipads install torrent software, like come on apple; let me download my Linux ISOs in peace D:). Then before we knew it we were about to board towards Helsinki (unfortunately without additional anime however).

As soon as we got on we were welcomed by a voice recording from Father Christmas himself, welcoming us to his airline and wishing us merry holidays (it was really sweet actually, the announcement was both in Finnish and in English). We then had a nice and uneventful flight which pretty much everyone in the family just slept through.

## Helsinki
As I said before our plane was about 20 mintes late, which cut into our time in the lounge at Helsinki, but boy was it worth it. We rushed to the food court, where we had two main dishes to choose from at the buffet, as well as freshly made foccacia! I unfortunately was so focused on eating I only remembered to snap a picture of the desert I had, which was amazing!

*the desert was amazing*

It was also here in the lounge we found our first public toilet with a bidet. Guess there are more places than Japan that have fancy toilets, huh. The lounge was very luxurious overall to be honest. There were Christmas trees everywhere, and there was even a little sled scene (diorama?) set up in the lobby area.

*very merry vibes indeed here*

On our way to the next plane I ran into this cool exhibition that I believed was supposed to show you what it looked like at different places in Finland. It was set to an area up north with Northern lights playing all over, and it was very pretty, but I didn't quite have time to stay and have a proper look.

==Northern Lights thingy==
*I want to see them in their full glory in real life one day*

We also ran past a little Moomin shop, which was just very inviting and cute. That was sort of the general vibe I got of the entire place as well. There's just something about Finland which is so calm and sweet. It feels like everything can sort of take the time it needs to. I don't know why, but I feel that way with the Finish language too. It's so pretty and soothing to me. The flow is really soothing, I just can't put my finger on what it is, but I love it.

## The second flight
We timed our arrival to the gate perfectly; they had already begun boarding, and it was just about our turn. I got a minor heart attack when my boarding pass failed the scan, but it turns out I had just managed to get the two swapped out and had tried scanning the one from my last flight.

*make sure to keep your boarding cards in check guys*

With that little mishap figured out we finally all got onto the big metal tube that was to be our residence for the next 13 or so hours. The Christmas spirit was in full swing here as well, with several of the stewardesses having red Santa hats. Unfortunately the merry atmosphere did nothing to get us off the ground on time, and this plane ended up running late. We ended up just sitting in the aeroplane for a full hour before takeoff (even the pilot was quick to voice his dismay over the intercom as he was told to taxi across the airport and then back again). This isn't to say that the time was uneventful however. As we were boarding you could see large amounts of snow on top of the airport, and that had to be washed off before we took off. It was a very strange procedure, but also quite cool. They had a group of trucks all spraying some chemical ==note to self, check how this works== on the plane to melt away all the snow! Certainly an experience.

Then finally we had liftoff! Food was served quite early on, and you could choose between meatballs or chicken katsu. I'm assuming they have one meal from the country you fly from and one from the country you fly to, which would be neat, but I'm not actually sure. There was soda included for free (a service I made abysmal use out of, but I'm pretty sure that it was "infinite"), and you could also get a small alcoholic beverage. I got myself some chicken katsu, and a can of Finnish beer. 

==Chicken katsu==
*honestly quite good, though I'm not sold on the pickled purple stuff*

*always a classic*

*a perfectly solid Finnish beer, would drink again*

Now comes the big question; what does one do on a 13 hour flight? I had thankfully come prepared, and was working on both making some finishing changes to the code behind this blog, as well as writing all of this text of course. I played some video games as well (I've been waiting to play an RPG in my steam library for ages, aaaaand, it's incredibly mid tier. Hopefully the story will pick up the pace in a while). I also watched some anime with my little brother (the late night downloads paying off). We shared earbuds for a few episodes of dandadan, and honestly it's an amazing show, albeit with a very peculiar premise. One of my roommates recommended it to me before I left, and I can really see why. I can wholeheartedly send that recommendation onwards. Go watch it. It's great. Of course I also spent some time sleeping as well, or rather trying to sleep. I didn't have a lot of space, having the middle seat and all, so I didn't manage to get hours of sleep or anything, but at least some amount of rest was good. We're going to go to bed quite soon after we land anyways.

Another fun thing with the flight are the in flight entertainment systems. I've never been on a plane this big in my adult life, so I'm not very used to it, but they are pretty cool. They come with both music and movies (I sort of half watched Deadpool X Wolverine without subtitles over my brother's shoulder whilst typing), as well as a whole slew of systems to keep track of where the plane is (you can even have a look through cameras mounted on the outside)! The one big downside with these systems, at least for us plebs in economy, is that they are mounted on the back of the chair in front of you, and they don't pivot at all. This means that when the person in front of you decides to lie down your screen suddenly moves a decimetre downwards, giving you a sore neck and a horrible viewing experience. I get that it's a cost saving measure, but is it really that expensive to just put in some nice hinges? (note, I was specifically asked by my brother to complain about this xD)

Towards the end of the flight, during a brief pause in her naps, Mum turns over and announces she has figured out The Thing We Forgotâ„¢ (there's always one thing on every single journey), and thankfully it was just that both me and her had forgotten to pack our bathing suits. Something easily solved at a store once we arrive.
