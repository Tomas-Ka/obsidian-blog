Today I made sure to sleep properly, and then planned out both what I wanted to do the next week, but also our trip to Kamakura and Enoshima island tomorrow!

For dinner we went to an authentic Chinese Ramen store, where we got to see a guy make our noodles by hand right in front of us! It was really cool and the noodle were incredibly tasty
