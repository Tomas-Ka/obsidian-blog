title: "Day 9: Back to Nakano Broadway"

Today was yet another late morning because of the late night yesterday (we should really fix that at some point), but when we eventually got out of the house we decided to head back to Nakano Broadway and then potentially head to Akihabara on our way home if we still had time.

We had a nice steak lunch at Nakano Broadway, where we got a miniature stovetop and got to finish grilling the meat ourselves! We then continued on to the actual shopping mall to look for figurines and whatnot. Some switch games were bought at a very good price (but not by yours truly), and then we return to Akihabara yet again (have you noticed I like that place yet?)!

*It was really really good...*

Once in the tech mecca we dashed from store to store through the rain, mostly looking at things, but also buying a couple of gacha items. In a small store selling self published stuff I found this really cool and creative CD (but didn't end up buying it)!

Eventually we met up with some friends (the same people we went drinking with [[Summer-Day-8|yesterday]]), and then we headed on home!

All in all it was a somewhat chill day after the chaos yesterday. Now we can but wait and see what tomorrow has to offer!
