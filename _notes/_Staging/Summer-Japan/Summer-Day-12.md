So, technically quite a few hours of this day was covered by [[Summer-Day-11|the previous entry]], since we ended up stuck in Shibuya for quite a while. But here's what happened after we eventually woke up at least!

Slowly dragging ourselves out of bed in the morning the only important task for the day was to get food. After some discussion it was decided that we would return to the Chinese noodle store we were at [[Summer-Day-10|two days ago]]. We got an even better view of the making of the noodles this time around, and they tasted just as good if not even better!

On our way home we also walked through some random stores, and I found this amazing everything / junk store which really just had absolutely everything you could ever want. I was very close to buying this cheap vinyl player that I found, but realising it would be impossible to get home I reluctantly had to leave it behind.

Since two more people were leaving today we decided to take one last trip into Akiba to get some last minute shopping done. Along with all the trinkets we got a really cool thing we'd been recommended from people loving here, a stain removal pen! It's a really neat concept actually, a little bottle and a set of papers that you rub on a stain to transfer it over to the paper. It's been incredibly effective, and we got several so we could bring some home as well. After wondering around for a little while we ended the evening with walking the 20 minutes to Ueno and having Wendy's (apparently they have lemon fries that a friend said tasted amazing. I'd say there were perfectly average). With that the day was over, now with only two of us to move into a new hotel tomorrow.
