<!-- Hachico statue -->
 <!-- scramble crossing sidebar-->
 <!-- 109? Sidebar left -->
Saw Hachico, scramble crossing and the 109 building (twewy reference?!)

Got interviewed on the side of the road by some random dude

Bought clothes at Uniqlo (summer stuff, which was really cool, but also very thin, to the point it was almost see-through).
 <!-- family Mart socks -->
Saw a Family Mart and finally bought some socks from my brother so he has that Family Mart drip

We also saw those go-karts people drive around, with tourists dressed up as characters. Saw a Mario and a picachu among others.

Finally we got dinner at a really expensive (by Japanese standards at least, it was in Shibuya after all) restaurant, had some food and some drinks, and then we headed on home.
