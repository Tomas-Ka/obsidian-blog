* breakfast
* met a Swedish guy at the shrine who say he was surprised to here Swedish here
* Prayer wall 
* The Holy wine and sake
* Me at the Shinto gate
* Insane amount of birds, to the point where you might think there were pre recorded 
* Shibuya crossing, 109 building and giant IKEA sign
* Shopping at Don Quixote
* See the Hachiko statue (they were rebuilding)
* Shibuya scramble crossing x 3
* Japanese Bible preacher talking at the crossing
* First ride on the metro went mostly without trouble. The only casualty was dad's head; he hit it on a bar when standing up from his seat which he only got for one stop anyways. Apart from that everyone did great
* Walk by a bike lot where the prices where what a major repair would cost at home
* Walked into store, ordered food, thought we ordered one too much, brother left, realised I wasn't that hungry... Food arrived, realised we're screwed. Typed out "We're very sorry but could you please cancel the fried rice" found out later at the hotel that we might have been one step too formal and ended up saying "we are deeply and terribly sorry" but it worked! We also managed to eat almost everything **and** walk all the way home
* got green tea with sake in it since I needed something to drink and the drink menu wasn't translated to English. I was assuming it'd have alcohol but I didn't know
