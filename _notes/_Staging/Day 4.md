* checked out from hotel
* Breakfast at a random place on the street which was, according to mum, the dirtiest place we'd been at yet. 
* Mum had napu? Beans. Not recommended. 
* I tried them, I agree
* Shinjuku station again. This time a lot easier because I sort of knew were we were going already. Were going to the Hakone region, so we're switching trains twice
  - Change at odaware
  - And hakonemoto (Hakone-yumoto)
  - Don't go out from the station
* Many train pictures (you're welcome Timo)
* Last train to gora switches directions and track! The conductor and the driver walked out and around the train to change places
* Second steepest train slope
* Tour guide in English on the train was really interesting
* Came early to hotel
* Cable car
* No way to cross tracks at station, must be annoying for people who live here to have to wait for the cable car to cross over xD
* Danish people on the cable car
* We saw mount Fuji!!
* Mission complete music as we got up
* Very hard to know if you're supposed to be right or left
* Black eggs
* Got in first into the second cable car
* Got a gachapon! And got the secret prize
* Walked around at the bottom, saw the pirate ship
* Evangelion statue at the bottom 
* Went back again, got a Christmas present
* saw Fuji with less clouds and then went all the way back to Gora. Taking an earlier stop on the mountain side Railcar, and walking to the Ryokan.
* Had my second ever rice in seaweed thingy, first one in Japan
* "Immensely Oishii" - dad
* Went to Onsen, very nice. Talk about image on onsen door??
* Showered in public bathroom and then bathed in private onsen. Honestly was very nice too. Nice to shower in a warm room. Wore yukata for both that and dinner, and we spent a good while figuring out how to wear them properly, but figured it out in the end! 
* We also went to bed with the Yukata on!
