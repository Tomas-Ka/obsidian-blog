* checked out from hotel
* Breakfast at a random place on the street which was, according to mum, the dirtiest place we'd been at yet. 
* Mum had napu? Beans. Not recommended. 
* I tried them, I agree
* Shinjuku station again. This time a lot easier because I sort of knew were we were going already. Were going to the Hakone region, so we're switching trains twice
  - Change at odaware
  - And hakonemoto (Hakone-yumoto)
  - Don't go out from the station
* Many train pictures (you're welcome Timo)
