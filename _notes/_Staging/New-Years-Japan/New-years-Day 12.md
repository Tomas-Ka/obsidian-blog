* Another travel day
* Woke up "early", and packed to get out for the Shinkansen.
* Waiting room and area were both packed, but dad managed to get some space when a kind Japanese gentleman held a seat for him.
* Fancy Shinkansen this time, got electrical sockets in the armrests
* Went and got Dominos pizza, everything else was pretty much closed
* Akihabara time!
* Went clothes shopping with mum
* How tf does the tax free work here???
* Went to Eorzea Cafe without booking, couldn't get in, booked for an hour or so later
* Bought gun breaker pin instead of astro since astro ones were out of stock (and bought more magnets!)
* Walked around just looking at things
* OMG EORZEA CAFE
* was amazing food was pretty decent.
* All the swag
* The space
* Took photos for the group besides us who won the cactpot
* Ran after them with a coaster when they forgot it later
* Met someone else who complimented my ffxiv bag (who ofc also had one just not with them)
* Limsa lominsa lessgo (funny since that's the only city I haven't started in)
* Didn't win cactput & announcement was in Japanese
* Â¥10k feels like a lot but it kinda isn't for 2 people eating
