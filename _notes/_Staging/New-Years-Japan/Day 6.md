title: Day 6: First day in Kyoto

* Went to a really fancy breakfast for breakfast. Minor panic when there weren't even prices on the menu even though I wasn't paying.
* Food was incredibly nice though, with a buffet for the starters and dessert, and then I got a very fancy sandwich with fries for my main course. Forgot to take pics of food but have of the locale because it was amazing. The look and feel of it made me think of a videogame called CrossCode. It was probably the music being sort of future jazzy. With synths and stuff. In any case, beautiful restaurant and a very good videogame. 
* Stupid door design of the hotel/restaurant makes you completely miss it
* Walked around the Gion area. Lots of temples, and lots of tourist stores, but also very pretty. I went on an excursion with mum alone, and we walked very very far.
