title: "Day 3: The Ghibli museum"
---
Today we had two missions; to see the staircase from the end of the `Your Name`
Movie, and then the big mission of the day was to see the Mitaka Studio Ghibli
museum!

This is another long day so hang on!

>So, uh, this is far in the future me here... Turns out I take a lot of notes, and that means having a lot to write about, which in turn means things take a while to type out. I had written about half this article before I got home from Japan (Up to visiting the Ghibli museum), but after that I just haven't had a lot of time to write, and thus this little project has sort of fallen to the wayside. Who would have thought having a blog is hard work xD. In any case I'll Hopefully be able to finish this thing over the next little while, albeit maybe skipping over some detalis and shortening things here and there.

# The Holy Place of Your Name
The staircase from the ending of `Your Name` is based on a real location, and of course we had to see it! The stairs lead up to Suga shrine, and are located in Shinjuku, the same area we were staying in! Because it was so close by we decided to walk there, and we saw plenty of interesting things on our way. 

==Car pic on right side?==
Something we've obviously seen a lot of are the Japanese cars, but on this walk specially we walked by a few parking lots filled with them, and this sparked a conversation about them. Mum thought they were really ugly, but I find the squished look super cute! You have to agree, just look at it! It's really just been slightly squished together lengthwise!

We also saw this poster for an ADO song. Ado is a quite famous (and incredibly talented) Japanese singer who skyrocketed into popularity just recently. I'm going to one of the concerts on her world tour in February next year, in Copenhagen! In any case it was incredibly cool to see a poster for her music just out on the street!

Then finally we got to the the Suga shrine and the famous red stairs! There was a little piece of laminated paper on a nearby vending machine welcoming us to the **Holy Place of Your Name**.

I have actually not seen `Your Name` yet (in spite of my brother trying to make me watch it), so I'm not entirely familiar with what the location means to the story, but I've got the general gist of it, and it was very cool to visit anyways (and now I *have* to see it some time soon). It was a very pretty day, and a very pretty location, so we took lots of pictures, and then proceeded on to the actual shrine, which had this beautiful chozuya (a little pavilion where you purify yourself before entering the temple):

==Cleansing "station" Suga shrine==

Our next stop was Shinjuku station where we would meet up with dad, get something to eat, and then catch a train to Mitaka.

# Shinjuku station
Oh god Shinjuku station. I've heard a lot about how hard it can be to find your way in this station, but both me and mum had talked about it before and figured it couldn't possibly be *that* bad, but oh god it was.

There were twisting corridors and several floors you needed to go up and down to get past obstacles in your way, and check in gates to the different train lines everywhere. We were trying to find dad, and ended up in a corridor with an arrow on the wall pointing to the location where he was (East Plaza), but then we we got to the end of the corridor (mind you there were no other exists here) there was an arrow pointing back the way we came saying the same thing!

==Map of Shinjuku station==
*The map looks deceptively simple, but that's because it doesn't take height into account!*

In the end we managed to find our way to him (turns out I'd been correct in my first attempt of finding him but then didn't realised we had to go up a floor and then around an entire platform before going back down to the ground floor again.

Then came the next task, getting to the food. The mall with our restaurant in it was closed on the second basement floor (floor -2), which meant the elevators were all shut off, but we wanted to go to floor -1 which was allegedly open. The only problem was once again that it was very hard to find where that entrance door was.

After wandering around a little while we did manage to find it however, and we were rewarded with some pretty great food, and what dad dubbed "the best beer I've ever had in Japan".

Finding our way to the next train was a lot easier than the others now that we had some experience with the station. We just so happened to have run past that line when trying to find dad previously.

# Mitaka Forest

==Rightimg sign to Ghibli museum==
We got on our train to Mitaka and got there with no major problems. After the train ride we walked for a good while, following these cute markers towards the **Ghibli Museum** in the **Mitaka Forest**.  The weather is beautiful, and as we get into the "forest" (which is just a really nice park), mum mentions that the weather forecast says that this nice weather is going to continue for all of our stay (which is another 1.5 weeks). Whether her prediction cursed us is something we will find out later...

==Rightimg of lemonade==

We find a cute cafe in the park called "The Bunny House" (Although their French translation was "The Hare House") to sit down and eat something in whilst waiting for our timeslot at the museum. I had some of the fluffiest pancakes I've ever had in my life. They were incredibly tasty, and I got a very nice and strong ginger lemonade to drink. Which I have some good friends who would absolutely adore (just like the day before).

==Pic of pancakes==

The cafe was incredibly sweet, it had a manual sliding door which surprised me more than it should have. I had just gotten so used to all the automatic ones that I sort of forgot manual ones existed. Also the bidet wasn't working at the cafe. I've genuinely began loving the feature, it's incredibly effective. Having warm toilet seats as well.

# The Ghibli Museum

We were still a bit early for the museum, but decided that we might as well go stand in the queue to get in a bit early. They were playing Christmas music over the speakers as we were standing there waiting outside, which I felt was fitting since it was the 24th of December after all. Then we talked to one of the gate attendants, and it turns out we were more than a bit too early, so we had to find a nice table to sit down and bask in the sun for a while taking in the park as well as all the japanese christmas "carols".

Eventually we got into the queue, and then into the museum itself. We weren't allowed to take any pictures inside, so I took notes instead (which is why I have so much to write about this day), and any images here are all from the internet.

The whole place was incredibly cool with lots of mentions and nods to different
ghibli movies (of course) but also with a lot of set pieces and other things
seemingly custom made for the museum. The whole family split up almost straight
away, and we all went off on our own little adventures.
<!-- TODO: check spelling of museeum everywhere! -->

Before I get into the nitty gritty of what actually exists there, I think it's
about time you get some idea of the layout of this place. It's twisty and bendy
with secret passageeways, every nook and cranny filled with some item or decoration.
It's as if the entire museeum come from straight out of a ghibli movie itself.
In the booklet we got (which also includes the map on the right) there were some
<!-- TODO: make sure we actually have the map on the side it says here ^ -->
words from mr Miyazaki himself about how they designed the place to be an experience
<!-- TODO: check spelling on the dude's name -->
in and of itself, a truly magical place.

==Map of Museeum here==

And magical it was. The main hall reminded me of the homey club house from
==name of ghibli movie with the incest here==, with an elevator and a staircase
going all the way to the top of the three story room, pointing your gaze
towards the beautiful fan and the intricate stained glass cieling.

I wondered around a little, first heading through the ==was it temporary?==
temporary exhibit about how animated moviee is made (where I got compliments
on my Final Fantasy XIV bag)! I didn't spend much time here however and after
quickly seeing everything I proceeded onwards up the stairs and into the art
room.

The art room was an entierly magical experience. Plastered across all the walls
were countless pieces of concept art, sketches and finished drawings. I found
some adorable early concept art for Kiki from `Kiki's delivery service`, and
saw some closeup shots from `Grave of the Fireflies` and a grown up (but not
old) version of Sophie from `Howl's movin castle`, all made with watercolours!
As far as I've come to understand all of the art for Ghibli movies (with
exceptions of course, like `Earwig and the witch`) are made with watercolours,
and seeing that in real life was something unreal. The rooms were not only
filled with drawings, but also decorated to look just like an actual drawing
room, filled with props and reference and paint everywhere. There was even a
violin just sitting on a chair!

==Image of grown up Sophie==

Putting all of this art next to each other really put it into perspective as
well. Next to each other `Nausicaä` and `Mononoke` look very similar, and all
the planes all over made you really apprechiate the beautful skies and
landscapes all over. I was really enamoured with a landscape from `Laputa`,
showing the floating city in all it's glory. The goregeous landscapes filled
with giant everyday objects of `Arrietti` next to all the tiny detailed
trinkets from Howl's room in `Howl's moving casle` it was all really gave this
feeling of nostalgia, of comfort and homeyness.

I carried on with my art viewing in the temporary installation for `The Boy and
the Heron` where I at first geniunely thought some of the images were reference
photography until I recognized a scene straight from the movie (I actually had
to go back and double check some of the previous images I had walked past, and
they were all hand drawn!!). They also showed a cool technique of painting on
plastic sheets to be able to overlay and move frames, to create things like
paralax effects in animation! Overall that entire installation made me realize
that I have to watch `The Boy and the Heron` again soon, because it was just so
pretty.

==Images from the Boy and the Heron==

As I was walking back out to the main chamber again (up on a little balcony /
walkway on the second floor), I noticed that some staff had cleared away an
area on the ground floor, and had started preparing for something. Feeling done
with my art-watching I decided to hang around on the balcony for a while to see
what was going on, and boy was that worth it. Just 10 minutes or so later a
group of five employees came out with cases of real brass bells, and I had a
perfect viewing angle from up on the balcony. They had two or three bells each
and as the whole museeum fell silent they started playing deck the halls.

The performance was a geniunely magical experience. I have never heard brass
bells being played before in real life, they have such a magestic sound.
It was beyond beautiful and just completely magical. They played the ending
song of ==That one ghibli movie ending song that I couldn't put my finger on but remember==,
<!-- 3 short going up, one going down then one going far up and long down down up + long 
Calm sung and with lyrics -->
which I instantly recognized, but couldn't figure out where it was from.
It was quite surreal actually, hearing music I was so nostalgic for and comforted
by, without knowing at all what it was or where it was from. Finally the
ensambles' performance ended with a marvelous Christmas medley, with all forms
<!-- TODO:     ^ Where should this apostrophe be???? -->
of classical carols, from carol of the bells to we wish you a merry christmas.
I truly cannot explain how magical it all was. And the fact that the five
musicians essentially sounded like one large singular entity despite them all
only having two or three tones each is something I still haven't quite wrapped
my head around properly.

After the performance people started dissipating quite quickly, leaving me to
ponder what I had just witnessed for a minute or two before heading up another
flight of stairs, finding the catbuss room (which was for small children), and
making my way up through a small spiral staircase up to the roof!

Here we were actually allowed to take pictures, and so I have a photo of me with
the giant Laputa robot statue on the roof, as well as of this faithfull recreation
of the stone inscription that acts like the control panel to the floating city.

== pics of stone inscrition and robot, maybe side by side to show difference from anime? ==

After all of that there were only two things to do, watching the exclusive
Ghibli museum movie, and shopping!

The rest of the family has already seen the little short film whilst I was
listening the Christmas music, so I queued up and went myself. When we first
had gotten into the museeum we had gotten small paper film reels, with frames
from actual ghibli movies that were the tickets to the movie screenings. The
reels had scenes from all over the Ghibli catalogue, but not from the movie
that we were about to watch. Turns out the museeum has these exclusive movies
on rotation, making new ones every so often. For a second I was a bit worried
about the language, since I was in Japan after all, but to my delight the
entire movie was speech-less. There were sound effects and the characters made
noises of course, but it was very clear that the movie was made with people of
all nationalities in mind. Anyhow, since this sweet little movie is quite hard
to get your hands on, I took the effort to summarize it once I got out.

Spoilers for the exclusive ghibli movie about the egg boy ahead I guess:
The movie was about a little egg guy, who in the beginning ends up at this which's
hut, was brought up by her, but forced to work for very meager food. At some point
He is working on a big ball of dough, and as he is sleeping, it comes alive!
The dough man and the egg boy escape from the witch together, and as soon as
she realizes she begins chasing after them. They run through the dark forest that
she inhabits, and eventually escape from the thorny underbrush and end up first
in a golden field of wheat, and then in a little town producing lots of bread.
At this point however the witch catches back up to them, and just as they escape
into the actual bakery (the building with the oven) she manages to get hold of
the dough man. She makes quick work of him, making him into loaves of dough,
but the little egg boy puts them back together right before the witch shoves
his new friend into the oven. It seems the witch wants to take the egg boy
back to her hut again, but with the amount of commotion that's been caused
by this hunt the king and queen of this little area appearr, and they also
happen to be eggs! It seems though they are the parents of the egg boy,
although that is unclear. As the witch starts to pull the egg boy back,
suddenly the oven starts rumbling. The dough man has been baked and turned
into bread, making him ripped! The now bread man scares the witch off (whilst also
giving her a piece of bread), and then the egg boy and the bread man leave the
town to travel together.

<!-- TODO: See if I can spell witch correctly here ^ -->
It was a really cute video, and even though it was short I got completely
immersed into it. It was quite magical and I left the little movie salong with
a nice warm feeling.

Next up was the final stop of the museeum, the merch store! There were so many
amazing things from all things ghibli, and in the end I ended up spending close
to like ¥18.000...
I got ghibli patches, and some pins and a laputa neclace that I feel like I'll
get a lot of use out of.

> Future me here, I did certainly get a lot of use out of that necklace, I have
> it on almost constantly now xD

After the shopping spree we had all individually decided that we'd seen everything,
and so we reconvened at the cafe, and took the train back to our hotel in Tokyo.

# The "Blue Cave" of Shibuya
One might think that this was the end of the day, but me and my mom managed to fit
in one more activity before we went to bed for the day. This was the last day
in Tokyo (for now, we'd be flying back from here later as well), and so we
decided to go see the `Blue Cave`! We went back to the metro, and crammed into
a wagon headed into the heart of Shibuya to see this beautiful lit up road full
of life with people milling about celebrating Christmas. Christmas is mostly a
couple's holiday in Japan (just like Valentines Day), so what we saw were
mostly lots of teens and young adults who were there with their partners, but
there were also a lot of young people there with friends, and some older people
too. We walked around a bit, saw a little video from a giant snowball, and then
headed back  home.
<!-- images of the Blue Cave -->

On the way home we stopped by an accessory shop, and I managed to buy a pair of
earrings as a Chrismas present to mum since the shop only took cash and she
didn't have any on hand. On the very final stretch home I noticed that my dear FFXIV
bag has begun to break (honestly it's a miracle it's survived this long, and
I hope I can get it fixed so I can continue using it), and we made a brief note
to try and find someplace to repair it durin the rest of our travels.
