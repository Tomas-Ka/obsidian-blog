title: Day 1; the journey there
---
The taxi dropped us off at our hotel and we quickly hopped out and got started with the check-in. It was a surprisingly involved process, and we checked in ourselves with a giant touch screen just inside the entrance. We were required to fill in many things, from home addresses to phone numbers (I understand the phone numbers, even though all ours were out of service because of the non-Japanese service provider, but home address?). We made a small mistake and accidentally put both me and mum on the room that was in her name, and then my brother and my dad went in the room in my name (why the second room wasn't booked in dad's name I don't know tbh). The process went through with no problem anyways and we quickly got settled into our new rooms.

The rooms were very small but had all the amenities you could possibly need. There was a giant queen size bed that took up about 3/4 of the room, a big tv, and a small bathroom with a toilet and a combination sink and shower. We also had an electric kettle, a fridge and both air conditioning and a humidifier! On the door was also two plastic bags with instructions on how to put them over your head of there was a fire. You'd never see anything like that back home!

After a quick look at all we have we decided to head out for dinner all together. We did not make it far, as we found a Hibachi grill restaurant in the lobby of our hotel. There an American family who were just getting seated when we got in, and we sat down at the bar together with them. The food was really good, we got A5 wagyu and all manner of other Japanese items, all from fish to meat to veggies and miso!

As is normal for Hibachi there was a lot of showmanship involved, lots of fun talk and fire and other things. After I said something was Umai, one of the chefs told me (through a lot of hand gestures and limited English) that that was for young boys, and then he turned to mum and taught her to say "Oishii" instead, which she learnt almost immediately. Guess that's what you could expect when you have been working in so many countries and learning so many languages!

There was more to the showmanship than just language though, and for the main dish of our dinner, the wagyu, the chefs asked us to pick up our phones and film him whilst he set fire to the food. When the other chef did the same thing a little while later the first one mimed having a fire extinguisher and pretended to spray all over the fire until it died down. It was a really cool experience!

When we had finished our meal we spent a little while talking with the two chefs. We taught them to say "tack s√• mycket" (thank you very much in Swedish), which they found very interesting and thanked us for a lot. Dad somehow got them into a conversation about their families and found out that they were both 65! Dad told them how old he was and how many children he had, and they both saluted and bowed to him, calling him Senpai. It was certainly a great start to our trip, and I'm really happy we went to that restaurant specifically, it had great food and even greater service!

After dinner my brother, mum and I decided to take a stroll around the area. Our hotel is located in an area of Tokyo called Shinjuku, which is the red-light district of Tokyo, and at night that really showed. Neon lights and computer screens everywhere, and tons upon tons of adverts for host clubs. We didn't get bothered at all on our stroll which I was a bit worried about before we set out, but we did see a few touts even though we didn't go through the main red-light streets.
