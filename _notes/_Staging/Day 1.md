title: Day 1; the journey there
---
The taxi dropped us off at our hotel and we quickly hopped out and got started with the check-in. It was a surprisingly involved process, and we checked in ourselves with a giant touch screen just inside the entrance. We were required to fill in many things, from home addresses to phone numbers (I understand the phone numbers, even though all ours were out of service because of the non-Japanese service provider, but home address?). We made a small mistake and accidentally put both me and mum on the room that was in her name, and then my brother and my dad went in the room in my name (why the second room wasn't booked in dad's name I don't know tbh). The process went through with no problem anyways and we quickly got settled into our new rooms.

The rooms were very small but had all the amenities you could possibly need. There was a giant queen size bed that took up about 3/4 of the room, a big tv, and a small bathroom with a toilet and a combination sink and shower. We also had an electric kettle, a fridge and both air conditioning and a humidifier!

After a quick look at all we have we decided to head out for dinner all together. We did not make it far, as we found a Hibachi grill restaurant in the lobby of our hotel. There an American family who were just getting seated when we got in, and we sat down at the bar together with them. The food was really good, we got A5 wagyu and all manner of other Japanese items, all from fish to meat to veggies and miso!
