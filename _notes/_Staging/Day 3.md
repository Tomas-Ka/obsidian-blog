title: "Day 3: The Ghibli museum"
---
Today we had two missions; to see the staircase from the end of the `Your Name` Movie, and then the big mission of the day was to see the Mitaka Studio Ghibli museum!

This is another long day so hang on!

<br>
# The Holy Place of Your Name
The staircase from the ending of `Your Name` is based on a real location, and of course we had to see it! The stairs lead up to Suga shrine, and are located in Shinjuku, the same area we were staying in! Because it was so close by we decided to walk there, and we saw plenty of interesting things on our way.

Something we've obviously seen a lot of are the Japanese cars, but on this walk specially we walked by a few parking lots filled with them, and this sparked a conversation about them. Mum thought they were really ugly, but I find the squished look super cute! You have to agree, just look at it! It's really just been slightly squished together lengthwise!

We also saw this poster for an ADO song. Ado is a quite famous (and incredibly talented) Japanese singer who skyrocketed into popularity just recently. I'm going to one of the concerts on her world tour in February next year, in Copenhagen! In any case it was incredibly cool to see a poster for her music just out on the street!

Then finally we got to the the Suga shrine and the famous red stairs! There was a little piece of laminated paper on a nearby vending machine welcoming us to the **Holy Place of Your Name**.

I have actually not seen `Your Name` yet (in spite of my brother trying to make me watch it), so I'm not entirely familiar with what the location means to the story, but I've got the general gist of it, and it was very cool to visit anyways (and now I *have* to see it some time soon). It was a very pretty day, and a very pretty location, so we took lots of pictures, and then proceeded on to the actual shrine, which had this beautiful chozuya (a little pavilion where you purify yourself before entering the temple):

==Cleansing "station" Suga shrine==

Our next stop was Shinjuku station where we would meet up with dad, get something to eat, and then catch a train to Mitaka.

# Shinjuku station
Oh god Shinjuku station. I've heard a lot about how hard it can be to find your way in this station, but both me and mum had talked about it before and figured it couldn't possibly be *that* bad, but oh god it was.

There were twisting corridors and several floors you needed to go up and down to get past obstacles in your way, and check in gates to the different train lines everywhere. We were trying to find dad, and ended up in a corridor with an arrow on the wall pointing to the location where he was (East Plaza), but then we we got to the end of the corridor (mind you there were no other exists here) there was an arrow pointing back the way we came saying the same thing!

==Map of Shinjuku station==
*The map looks deceptively simple, but that's because it doesn't take height into account!*

In the end we managed to find our way to him (turns out I'd been correct in my first attempt of finding him but then didn't realised we had to go up a floor and then around an entire platform before going back down to the ground floor again.

Then came the next task, getting to the food. The mall with our restaurant in it was closed on the second basement floor (floor -2), which meant the elevators were all shut off, but we wanted to go to floor -1 which was allegedly open. The only problem was once again that it was very hard to find where that entrance door was.

After wandering around a little while we did manage to find it however, and we were rewarded with some pretty great food, and what dad dubbed "the best beer I've ever had in Japan".

Finding our way to the next train was a lot easier than the others now that we had some experience with the station. We just so happened to have run past that line when trying to find dad previously.

# Mitaka Forest

==Rightimg sign to Ghibli museum==
We got on our train to Mitaka and got there with no major problems. After the train ride we walked for a good while, following these cute markers towards the **Ghibli Museum** in the **Mitaka Forest**.  The weather is beautiful, and as we get into the "forest" (which is just a really nice park), mum mentions that the weather forecast says that this nice weather is going to continue for all of our stay (which is another 1.5 weeks). Whether her prediction cursed us is something we will find out later...

==Rightimg of lemonade==

We find a cute cafe in the park called "The Bunny House" (Although their French translation was "The Hare House") to sit down and eat something in whilst waiting for our timeslot at the museum. I had some of the fluffiest pancakes I've ever had in my life. They were incredibly tasty, and I got a very nice and strong ginger lemonade to drink. Which I have some good friends who would absolutely adore (just like the day before).

The cafe was incredibly sweet, it had a manual sliding door which surprised me more than it should have. I had just gotten so used to all the automatic ones that I sort of forgot manual ones existed. Also the bidet wasn't working at the cafe. I've genuinely began loving the feature, it's incredibly effective. Having warm toilet seats as well.

# The Ghibli Museum

We were still a bit early for the museum, but decided that we might as well go stand in the queue to get in a bit early. They were playing Christmas music over the speakers as we were standing there waiting outside, which I felt was fitting since it was the 24th of December after all. Then we talked to one of the gate attendants, and it turns out we were more than a bit too early, so we had to find a nice table to sit down and bask in the sun for a while (listening to the Christmas music).

Then eventually we got into the queue, and then into the museum itself. We weren't allowed to take any pictures inside, so any images here are all from the internet.

* The environment drawings from the boy and the heron look like actual photos
* plastic sheets over background to create parallax
* I need to watch the boy and the heron again is so beautiful
* People playing Christmas music on bells in the foyer. Like real brass bells! They started with deck the halls. Five people with a large amount of bells they all held 2 each
* Holy ducking shit this is beautiful, I didn't even know bells could make sounds like that played some Ghibli ending theme I recognise from recently, maybe the one with the girl who died in tuberculosis? Gotta have a more proper look. Maybe incest movie? Ponyo??
* Also played a Christmas medley. It was incredibly impressive how they sounded like a single instrument!
* Room with the catbus
* Very small spiral staircase leading upwards was cool
* Took a pic with Laputa robot
* Spent like ¥18.000 at the store

* Was about a little egg dude who ends up at a witch's place and finds a friend made out of dough. The two of them escape and the witch chases them. They end up in a town where the townsfolk are all making bread. The witch catches up to them, makes the dough guy into bread loaves, little egg guy helps putting them together and then the witch throws him into the oven. The king and the queen of this little town appear and they are also eggs! The now baked (and ripped) bread man gets out of the oven and scares the witch of (also giving her a piece of bread) then the egg and the bread man leave the town to travel together.
* My ffxiv bag is breaking!
* Me and mum going on an adventure just the two of us to see the "blue Cave" in Shibuya.
