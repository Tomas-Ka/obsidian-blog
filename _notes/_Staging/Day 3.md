* mum find the squished cards ugly, I think they're cute. They look like someone just took a normal car and pressed it together lengthwise
* Ado poster
* The Holy place of `Your Name`
* And accompanying shrine 
* Shinjuku station being Shinjuku station 
* Arrows for where to go pointing into each other
* God finding things in Shinjuku sucks. The mall was closed on floor -1, but -2 was open, we just didn't know how to get in. Eventually we found it, and we're rewarded with food, and according to dad, "the best beer I've ever had in Japan"
* It seems like the different metro stations have different jingles. Might be dependant on the line too, I'll have to have a proper look at some point!
* Mum says the weather will be nice all the time we're here....
* We had some of the fluffiest pancakes I've ever had in my life. They were incredibly tasty, and I got a very nice and strong ginger lemonade.
* Completely manual door
* Bidet wasn't working. I've genuinely began loving the feature so it was unfortunate

* Can't dodge Christmas music even at the Ghibli museum
* We were too early and spent a good while basking in the sun whilst waiting for 14:00 so we could go in.
* Main stress looks like the club house from the film with the incest
* Got compliments for my bag

* Grown up Sophie
* Laputa drawings!!!
* A violin in the example drawing/art room
* Lots of plane drawings
* Nausicaä and Mononoke next to real other lives really similar
* Scribbled with crayon! Or colour pens at least
* Gorgeous landscapes for ariett
* All the trinkets in Howl
* Such a feeling of nostalgia
* We get to see storyboards as well
* The environment drawings from the boy and the heron look like actual photo plastic sheets over background to create parallax
* I need to watch the boy and the heron again is so beautiful
* People playing Christmas music on bells in the foyer. Like real brass bells! They started with deck the halls. Five people with a large amount of bells they all held 2 each
* Holy ducking shit this is beautiful, I didn't even know bells could make sounds like that played some Ghibli ending theme I recognise from recently, maybe the one with the girl who died in tuberculosis? Gotta have a more proper look. Maybe incest movie? Ponyo??
* Also played a Christmas medley. It was incredibly impressive how they sounded like a single instrument!
* Room with the catbus
* Very small spiral staircase leading upwards was cool
* Took a pic with Laputa robot
* Spent like ¥18.000 at the store
* Went to see the exclusive Ghibli museum film
* Was about a little egg dude who ends up at a witch's place and finds a friend made out of dough. The two of them escape and the witch chases them. They end up in a town where the townsfolk are all making bread. The witch catches up to them, makes the dough guy into bread loaves, little egg guy helps putting them together and then the witch throws him into the oven. The king and the queen of this little town appear and they are also eggs! The now baked (and ripped) bread man gets out of the oven and scares the witch of (also giving her a piece of bread) then the egg and the bread man leave the town to travel together.
* My ffxiv bag is breaking!
* Me and mum going on an adventure just the two of us to see the "blue Cave" in Shibuya.
* Getting packed into a Metro train
* Do the doors alternate sides when stopping? Will have to investigate
* Went into accessory shop on way back, got to pay cash for some earrings that mum wanted
